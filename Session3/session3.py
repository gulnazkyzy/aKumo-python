# Class task 2:

# Character counter 
# Take an input of the word/sentence
# Calculate how many 'a' characters are in the word/sentence

# Input: aKumoSolutions      # Input: banana
# # Output: 1                  # Output: 3

# sentence = input("Please enter the input: ")
# counter = 0 

# for char in sentence:
#     if char == "o":
#         counter = counter + 1

# print(counter)

# Hint: use counter for your output
# key: char
# value: (constantly changes)

# sentence = input("Please enter the input: ")

# counter = 0 
# if len(char_inp) ==1:
